# CivClicker Mobile

## Overview

CivClicker is an "incremental game" based on Cookie Clicker. This project is a responsive/mobile-friendly adaption of the original CivClicker game that also aims to add some new features (e.g. additional icons, hotkeys, support for translation into languages other than English) and other improvements.

## Gameplay

Gather food, cut wood, and mine stone to support a growing population of workers while building a civilization. Gather a collection of cats in the process.

The original CivClicker has the following succinct advice about getting started:

> Q: How do I get started?
>
> A: If you want people, you'll need to have enough food to support them, and they will need to have a place to live. Make sure you have enough food and at least a tent or wooden hut to start with.
>
> Q: I made a worker, but they died straight away!
>
> A: Workers eat food. Do you have enough spare?
